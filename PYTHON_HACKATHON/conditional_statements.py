    # Ask the user for their age and attempt to convert it to a float
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

    # Use a conditional statement to check if the user is eligible to vote
if age >= 18:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
        print("You are not eligible to vote.")
    # The conditional statement in this snippet checks if the user's age is greater than or equal to 18 but does not accept float. 
    # If it is, the program prints a message that the user is eligible to vote. 
    # If the user's age is less than 18, the program prints a message that the user is not eligible to vote. 
    # This is an example of a simple conditional statement.
